# VS CODE Snippets

**This one is made for my personal usage, you can add functions as you wish and edit my name and doc.**

## Setup

- Select User Snippets (at top menubar, File/Code [for **mac**] > Preferences > User Snippets) and then select **cpp.json**.
  ![Top Bar](/images/top_bar.png)
- copy or replace the [cpp.json file](./Snippets/cpp.json) and save.

## Usage

- Creating a cpp file if you type **inc** and press **Tab** in your keyboard the **snippet** will load as i have set **prefix** as **inc** in my **json file** . (**You can edit as your own !**)
- This will make programming easy and fast .
